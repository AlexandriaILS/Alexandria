# Contributing Documentation

Documentation is the heart and soul of any project, and this documentation is no different. We strive for the highest level of accuracy, readability, and simplicity -- docs need to be easy to understand and easy to follow. 

The pages in this section cover how to install Retype (the documentation engine we use), layouts for new pages, and guidelines for making new pages the best that they can be!

* [Installing Retype](installing_retype.md)
* [Documentation Layout](doc_layout.md)
* [Example Page](example_page.md)
* [Documentation Best Practices](best_practices.md)
