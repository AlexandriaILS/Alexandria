# Contributing

Looking to help us out? Welcome! Let's get you set up to work on our stuff.

* If you're wanting to work on the codebase itself, you'll need to get an environment set up on your computer. Head over to [Environment Setup](environment_setup.md) to get started.
* If documentation is your goal, go to [Documentation](documentation.md) to learn how to edit our docs!

If you've got a question that we don't have an easy answer for, let's figure it out together and make sure we get it added here!
