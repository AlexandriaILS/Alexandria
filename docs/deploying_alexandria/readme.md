# Running Alexandria

When deploying your own instance of Alexandria, there are a number of things you might need to know or reference as you go. This documentation is under construction, but if there's a missing page that you need then please [let us know on GitHub](https://github.com/AlexandriaILS/Alexandria/issues).

The pages in this section cover how to deploy Alexandria to production for your library.
