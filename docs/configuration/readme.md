# Configuring Alexandria

When configuring your own instance of Alexandria, there are a number of things you might need to know or reference as you go. This documentation is under construction, but if there's a missing page that you need then please [let us know on GitHub](https://github.com/AlexandriaILS/Alexandria/issues).

The pages in this section cover how to update the settings for Alexandria for your library, custom edits you can make to the codebase to make it work better for you, and more!
