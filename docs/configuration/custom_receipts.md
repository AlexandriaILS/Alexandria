# Custom Receipts

## Introduction

Alexandria is configured out of the box to use the [Epson TM-T88V receipt printer](https://epson.com/For-Work/Point-of-Sale/POS-Printers/TM-T88V-POS-Receipt-Printer/p/C31CA85084), mostly because that's what we have on hand to work with. If you have a different type of receipt printer, then you may want to adjust the receipts that come with Alexandria to work better for your printers.

!!!danger :rotating_light: Hey, listen! :rotating_light:
Receipt printing **will ONLY work** with [Alexandria's companion staff application](https://github.com/AlexandriaILS/alexandria-electron/releases). Receipts are the only part of Alexandria that cannot be done through your web browser. You can go through processes that would generate a receipt (like check out or check in) through your browser, but a receipt will not print.
