![Automated Tests Status](https://github.com/AlexandriaILS/Alexandria/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

It should include:

* ğŸŸ  searching by various fields
* ğŸŸ  a locked-down web view for library staff
* ğŸŸ¢ ability to add new titles
* ğŸŸ¢ ability to import titles by MARC record
* ğŸŸ  printing receipts
* ğŸŸ  hold management
* ğŸ”´ email notification capabilities
* ğŸ”´ handle fines with Stripe
* ğŸŸ¢ support for multiple locations
* ğŸŸ¢ support for multiple systems
* ğŸ”´ support for federated systems
* ğŸ”´ support for books checked out by staff (no due date)
* ğŸ”´ support for books that need to be weeded
* ğŸ”´ support for replacing weeded books
* ğŸ”´ investigate adding bookstore functionality for sale of weeded materials

...and probably more. Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
