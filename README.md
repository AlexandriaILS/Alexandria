# Bespoke. Books. Battlestar Galactica.

![Automated Tests Status](https://github.com/AlexandriaILS/Alexandria/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

The plan here is to design and implement, mostly for the sake of practice, an integrated library system for a small library.

It should include:

* 🟠 open web view for patrons
* 🟠 searching by various fields
* 🟠 a locked-down web view for library staff
* 🟢 ability to add new titles
* 🟢 ability to import titles by MARC record
* 🟠 printing receipts
* 🟠 hold management
* 🔴 email notification capabilities
* 🔴 handle fines with Stripe (billing, part 1)
* 🟢 support for multiple locations
* 🟢 support for multiple systems
* 🔴 support for books checked out by staff (no due date)
* 🔴 support for books that need to be weeded
* 🔴 investigate adding bookstore functionality for sale of weeded materials (billing, part 2)

Planned features for V2 release:

* 🔴 support for federated systems

...and probably more. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
