# Bespoke. Books. Battlestar Galactica.

The plan here is to design and implement, mostly for the sake of practice, an integrated library system for a small library.

It should include:

* open web view for patrons
* searching by various fields
* a locked-down web view for library staff
* ability to add new titles
* ability to import titles by MARC record
* hold management
* email notification capabilities
* handle fines with Stripe
* support for multiple locations
* support for books checked out by staff (no due date)
* support for books that need to be weeded
* support for replacing weeded books

* investigate adding bookstore functionality for sale of weeded materials

...and probably more. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
