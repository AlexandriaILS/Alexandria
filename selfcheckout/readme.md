This app should be used to build a self-checkout station. Ideally this should only require a raspberry pi and a scanner, this should have the following functionality:

* single page (primarily, login doesn't count)
* requires staff login to start (don't want people checking out arbitrary materials at home)
* offers print ability for receipts
* offers email receipt
